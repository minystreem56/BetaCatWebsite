# BetaCat Website Help

For if you don't understand how to use the website, or you are just here because why not.

## Links

The BetaCat website is the official website for BetaCat. Here are all of the links:

* [Published Site (Stable)](https://minystreem56.github.io/BetaCatWebsite/)

The published site is what we reccomend, because everything is complete and tested.

* [Dev Site (Experimental)](https://betacat.ian-codes.repl.co/)

The dev site is not as complete and isn't always fully tested. This bugs out more than the published site.
